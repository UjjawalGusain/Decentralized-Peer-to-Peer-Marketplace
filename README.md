**Quak'r** is a little marketplace with a big heart â€” where folks come to trade, swap, and share without all the fuss.
Just like a cute little yellow rubber duck in a pond, quak'r is simple fun and very quirky.

You have some old, used or refurbished item? Quak's is the place where you can sell it.

You want to buy some second hand product? Just check if someone nearby is selling it, and with a few clicks, it's yours.

We aim to make it simple. No middleman. Just a community built with trust. Nothing more, nothing less. 
The only thing that quacks, is our duck.

(Note - Quak'r community loves rubber ducks. We stand firmly with them. Any intention against our rubber ducks is not tolerated. Peace.)
